  <p>Dear God, May others find hope in the lessons you have taught me. With Love, Lisa </p>

  <p> Letter to God... Dear God, How can I be in the most wonderful place where your presence resides and not even see you? I miss you unless I'm striving to see you. In reality I miss you when I don't seek you with all my heart. I miss you when I don't desire to meet with you. I miss you when I don't drawn near. You tell me to draw near and you will draw near to me. Thank you for your faithfulness. Thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for your love and provision. Thank you for my husband Matthew- a gift! </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>My Beloved Always and forever.</p>
  <p>Lisa</p>

  <p> Dear God, My heart is healing. As I seek you with all of my heart I find you. Thank you for all the good in my life. Help my husband to feel loved even when I don't love myself. Help me to see where I am holding back. You are faithful God! I thank you that you model to me an everlasting love. Thank you for desiring relationship with me and wanting me to be open and honest with myself and others. Help me to trust others as I have learned to trust you. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Dear God, Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for all the lives you imagined and breathed into existance. Thank you for holding my hand and staying near me. Thank you for holding my hand and staying near me. Thank you that you created each person with hearts that are capable of love through you. While we cannot begin to have the strength you have, you give us your strength to complete what you have called us to. Thank you for calling us your sons and daughters. Help us to humble ourselves and know with confidence who we are and whose we are with compassion and grace serving you because we are compelled by love for you, our Savior! Remind us how valuable we are and pull out the red carpet when we need to see you exalted and lifted up! </p>
  <p>Thank you Father. </p>
