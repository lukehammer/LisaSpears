<p>The Empowering Coach&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am an empowering coach.</p>

<p>I have the right to be what I want-so I choose to be empowering.</p>

<p>I seek opportunity-not security.</p>

<p>I will not be limited in my possibilities</p>

<p>or focused on my past. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I will take the high road,&nbsp;</p>

<p>to be and to improve,&nbsp;</p>

<p>to dream and to build, to transform fear into faith, and take risk in the
pursuit of success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I prefer the challenges of life to the guaranteed existence,&nbsp;</p>

<p>the thrill of learning and growing to the bondage of self-doubt.</p>

<p>I will not trade excellence for mediocrity</p>

<p>or shy away from obstacles.</p>

<p>It is my heritage and my choice&nbsp;</p>

<p>to stand with assurance,&nbsp;</p>

<p>to act on behalf of what is good for the cause of a healthy world.</p>

<p>As I coach I can leave a legacy</p>

<p>where others can enjoy the benefits</p>

<p>of what has been created.</p>

<p>I can face the world boldly and say:</p>

<p>&quot;This has been created by an empowering coach, and that coach is
me.&quot;</p>

<p>~Carl Casanova</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Life goal: Have a heart that says thank you and just sings!</p>

<p>Nothing but the Blood of Jesus</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>What can wash away my sin?</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus;</p>

<p>What can make me whole again?</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Oh! Precious is the flow</p>

<p>That makes me white as snow;</p>

<p>No other fount I know,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>For my pardon, this I see,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For my cleansing this my plea,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Nothing can for sin alone,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus;</p>

<p>Naught of good that I have done,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>This is all my hope and peace,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is all my righteousness,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus. &nbsp;</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Now by this I'll overcome-</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now by this I'll reach my home-</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Glory! Glory! This I sing-</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus,&nbsp;</p>

<p>All my praise for this I bring-</p>

<p>Nothing but the blood of Jesus.</p>

<p>Written by- Robert <span class=GramE>Lowry &nbsp;@</span>1876</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Reach Out Your Hands</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Reach out your hands</p>

<p>Let your heart rejoice</p>

<p>The Lord of the Harvest has chosen you.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Let your voice sing out</p>

<p>Clap your hands</p>

<p>Sing a song for the Lord will come for you.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Give thanks to the Lord He loves you so</p>

<p>Oh, Little One</p>

<p>Climb in his lap and love Him back.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>He's waiting for you because He loves you so&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh won't you open your heart,&nbsp;</p>

<p>And let Him in?</p>

<p>Oh won't you open your heart and let him in?</p>

<p style='margin-bottom:12.0pt'>(God, may you use this song to bring your dear little
ones whom you love to you.&nbsp; Thank you for choosing me to bring Glory to
your name.)</p>

<p>Puppies and Dogs</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Puppies are cute,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Puppies are fun.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>They're always playful,&nbsp;</p>

<p>When they're young!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>They don't mean to bite,</p>

<p>Especially not fight.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Some like to swim,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some like to run,&nbsp;</p>

<p>And some even like to play in the sun!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>They can do lots of things,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like play hide and seek,</p>

<p>Go to the zoo,&nbsp;</p>

<p>And chew up your shoe!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>They're cute when they're young,&nbsp;</p>

<p>They're cute when they're old,</p>

<p>They run like the <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>wind,but</span></span>
they're had to hold.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>They run in <span class=SpellE>therain</span>,&nbsp;</p>

<p>And get all muddy!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>But when they're not dirty,&nbsp;</p>

<p>They seem so cuddly!</p>

<p>Memories of Uganda</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>I step out of the plane</p>

<p>And I'm Home.</p>

<p>No more waiting, no more wondering;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just Living!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>I'm Living in the moment.</p>

<p>Strange faces, out of place</p>

<p>And yet, they're all familiar to me.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Lord's prepared me&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this moment-</p>

<p>A moment I never knew.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>I want to follow my dreams</p>

<p>Don't let me lose my vision.</p>

<p>&quot;Father keep me healthy, Father keep me safe.</p>

<p>Let me stay here in this place.&quot;</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Sitting under a mango tree&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ears wide open...</p>

<p>&quot;Speak to me.</p>

<p>Tell me why this feels so right.&quot;</p>

<p>Let me practice patience</p>

<p>Let me do what's right.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>A doubly-large bee is in the&nbsp;<span class=SpellE><i>cho</i></span>&nbsp;with
me</p>

<p>People laugh when I speak the language.</p>

<p>I can't stop saying period and there's full stops after every word.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>I almost got run over, I didn't hear&nbsp;<i>the beep</i>.</p>

<p>Eye brows yes and unspoken communication.</p>

<p>Culture Shock!</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>The Lord has brought me here, I'll persevere.</p>

<p>I finally got to Africa-</p>

<p>Do I really have to leave?</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Don't let me lose my vision</p>

<p>I'm bending on my knees.</p>

<p>Let me see things your way;</p>

<p>Grant me self-control.</p>

<p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p>Thanks for keeping me healthy.</p>

<p>Thanks for keeping me safe.</p>

<p>Lord you are so faithful...</p>

<p>Faithful to you I will be!</p>

<p>Thankful</p>

<p>I am human...</p>

<p>Washed in his presence anew</p>

<p>Stories of old beginning to unfold</p>

<p>Putting off bitterness, anger and strife</p>

<p>Lo and behold it's all that I'm told</p>

<p>Joy in the journey that's not a destination</p>

<p>Ask me why I love my Jesus</p>

<p>Round and round, through and through</p>

<p>Ashes into beauty, renewed by His embrace</p>

<p>Living <span class=GramE>water</span> you say is the way</p>

<p>I found my relief through my grief</p>

<p>Times of confusion and days of pain</p>

<p>Everlasting Father I want you still</p>

<p>Lessons learned to leave a legacy</p>

<p>Wisdom and discernment prepare the way</p>

<p>Life of intentionality</p>

<p>Proverbs 31 and all it shall say</p>

<p>Impacting my world through my ministry of home</p>

<p>Marriage and parenting create space for it all</p>

<p>Forgiveness with mercy and grace</p>

<p>Make way for this daily choice</p>

<p>Praying in faith</p>

<p>Loving and serving others</p>

<p>A lifetime of purpose in God's command:</p>

<p>&quot;Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and love your
neighbor as you love yourself&quot;</p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Self acceptance</span>- a key to this journey</p>

<p><span class=SpellE>Self forgetfulness</span>- a new thought for the journey</p>

<p>No more do, do, do but more of be, be, be- in this journey called life</p>

<p>I found hope at the end of the road called suffering</p>

<p>Love unconditional in this amazing grace</p>

<p>A story of reflection in the seasons of life</p>

<p>Undeniably imperfect but there is one who's not</p>

<p>My beloved Father</p>

<p>Whom I seek to know more</p>

<p>Laying down strongholds</p>

<p>Like never before</p>

<p>God is love</p>

<p>The answer to my hearts prayer</p>

<p>God is trustworthy</p>

<p>As we can only desire to be</p>

<p>Questions to answers</p>

<p>Chaos to order</p>

<p>Fear to peace</p>

<p>Never alone</p>

<p>There is joy and contentment in this journey called life</p>

<p>There is a way out of this earthly strife</p>

<p>Changing the world one person at a time</p>

<p>It starts and ends with me.</p>

<p>Suffering</p>

<p>Salvation through suffering not salvation from suffering.</p>

<p>When life looks hopeless-</p>

<p>Suffering is a part of Jesus' story.</p>

<p>You are sons and daughters of the King, rooted <span class=SpellE>int</span>
he <span class=GramE>rock</span>, brought from darkness to light.&nbsp; No
longer slaves to fear.&nbsp; We were made to be unashamed and bringing glory to
God.&nbsp; If we don't build ourselves into the <span class=GramE>rock</span>
we will crash right into the rocks.</p>

<p>Once we were not a people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We had no claim on God.</p>

<p>Now we are God's people. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The only reason our life has been built into the rock of Christ, is because
we have been shown mercy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our invitation: Come to God.&nbsp; We can't serve God without God.&nbsp; We
are God's special possession.&nbsp; We declare His praises. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Pray for others to receive mercy as we have received mercy.</p>

<p>Let us be unashamed of the gospel. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Let us walk boldly declaring the praises of God who called us out of the
darkness and into the light to sing His praises.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How to we suffer and not respond?</p>

<p>How do we deal with justice, be good, but not retaliate? &nbsp;</p>

<p>He made no threats but measured himself to Him who judges justly.<br>
<br>
Vengeance is His.</p>

<p>He is the judge of all.</p>

<p>Let go...</p>

<p>Suffering unjustly opens a window into the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>God is driven by love.</p>

<p>Lessons Learned:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lord woke me up at 3:30<span class=GramE>.&nbsp; I</span> hoped he would
wake me up again at 4:00 so feeling tired, I closed my eyes and fell back
asleep.&nbsp; The next hour and a half felt like only minutes as God revealed
the condition of my heart through a dream. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Matt and I were driving and Matt was in the back seat.&nbsp; He was in a
state of being drunk like.&nbsp; We arrived at the location where he would be
working with youth through the group mentoring for boys that he does.&nbsp; I
told him he shouldn't go and explained the shift in his personality I had seen
in him.&nbsp; He said he didn't see it.&nbsp; I begged that he talk to the head
of the program and he said he didn't see the change.&nbsp; Feeling I needed to
do something about this, I left the baby up the hill and trudged up the hill.&nbsp;
When I was approached and asked if I needed help, I persevered trudging up a
steep hill.&nbsp; When I made it to Matt, he apologized to me and I responded
by slapping him.&nbsp; I told him he shouldn't do that.&nbsp; Walking off, I
heard him ask someone what he should do to make things right and I was really
mad because the advice was to bring home something.&nbsp; He went off to apply
this advice and I just got mad.&nbsp; I became frightened and worried.&nbsp; I
rolled through a stop-light with a police officer behind me and he let me go
on.&nbsp; I became <span class=GramE>more angry</span> and out of
control.&nbsp; I learned I need to stop trying to fix people and pray for
them.&nbsp; This is a lesson I continue to learn.</p>
