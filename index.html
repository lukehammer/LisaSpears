  <p>All the adversity I've had in my life, all my troubles and obstacles, have strengthened me... You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you. ~Walt Disney </p>
  <p>In the first two years of marriage, I heard a message addressed to 
    Mr. &amp; Mrs. Blockhead. </p>
  <p>Both my husband and I mutually bonded over this because we had a hard time seeing marital bliss.  We were the not so happy honeymooners.  Adding humor in all the heated tension was exactly what we needed. </p>
  <p>My husband and I both work diligently on our marriage but unless we are both investing ourselves into what we we were born to do then we struggle without a healthy outlet.  When I think of what I want in a marriage it is motivating to keep focused on growth, but equally there are some examples that motivate through seeing what you don't want and moving away from it by focusing on my goal and what I do want.  My eyes locked on a couple that came in slowly to the foyer of the building as I waited for the rain outside to stop pouring.  In this moment, the wife begins pointing at her husband and asking him for his jacket.  He failed to notice she was cold and said: This is my jacket" and then put it on.  I couldn't help but think he had missed the opportunity to serve her by handing her the jacket but as I watched further I saw how he served her with smile and heart to find out just what she really needed.  She proceeded to use her cane to tap at him.  He couldn't hear and kept offering her many wonderful options.  I watched how he cared for his wife selflessly.  As he graciously served his wife I noticed his wife's response in return.  I felt as though she barked at him through her expectations.  I couldn't help but think how we treat people how to treat us.  This man joyfully served his wife despite her ungracious responses.  I saw myself in the woman and I saw my husband in the man.  Both wanted to connect but in their own human frailties they were unable to help one another. </p>
  <p> I am young and have many more opportunities to practice responding with gentleness.  I believe it will help my husband and I as we grow old together when we work toward responding to each other in love. </p>
  <p>My Purpose: I am an educator.  At my core, I love teaching phonics to children, helping people feel heard and connected through language and helping  adults to be the best educational advocate for their child.  I am committed to educating families and making resources available to support parents in meeting their child's educational needs.  I possess the ability to help support parents in being the best educational advocate for their children.  My purpose is to nurture families to creatively empower and equip their children to meet their educational goals. </p>
  <p>My story:  We all have a story of redemption and I'd like to help you find yours.  I heard reference to being mended by God.  This does not resonate with my soul.  I've heard many references to being made complete by God, but to recognize that I in my humanity will never be made perfect is unsettling to me.  I don't know about you, but torn and mended is something I often look at as imperfect as something to discard or get rid of as soon as possible.  What is this concept that my imperfection is a gift. </p>
  <p>My Title: Educational Advocate, Coach, Mentor, Tutor </p>
  <p>We are the product of all that has ever happened to us.  Every experience we have lived through has helped shape who we are and the way we look at the world.  If we are lucky, we have had some guidance about how to deal with our frustrations and heartbreak.  Most of us simply try to figure it out as we go.  The next time you notice yourself with a negative outlook, try asking yourself what it is about.  And then ask again.  As discussed above, it is often not what has happened to us, but what we tell ourselves that leads to our feeling negative.  What we tell ourselves is based on the entire history of wrongs we have ever lived through.  When we feel strongly about something, many times it is because what has occurred taps into the last time we felt wronged, unheard or disrespected.  Finding freedom from the old stories means we get to write new endings to all our unfinished business. 
    It can be an exciting, liberating, journey into positivity to experience life as it comes, with eyes wide open, sensing, living, and then letting go. </p>
